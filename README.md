# Named Entity Recognition

### Description
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a sub-task of information extraction in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that classifies named entities into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, and more. In the realm of NLP, understanding these entities is crucial for many applications, as they often contain the most significant information in a text.
